Dick's pseudocode for Web Scraper
----------------------------------------

First, the developer must install PIP and Beautiful Soup
Dev must also use cURL to get and post requests to a URL:
input into the cmd line:
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py 
hit enter, then input:
python get-pip.py
hit enter again. Input 'pip -v' to see if the install worked
Install Beautiful Soup, input in cmd line:
pip install beautifulsoup4
then install requests:
pip install requests
and consider installing the html5 library:
pip install html5lib
